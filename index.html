		<p>Yet another custom lorem ipsum generator, this time using quotes from the TV show <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxKjuqadoh0">Friends</a>. Well, it was originally just Friends, but then <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=STp1tesmVXc">Scrubs</a> and <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQdp7rN6vUs">Rick & Morty</a> got added. Use it as a filler in your websites if you want. Or not, it's up to you. You can find the <a href="//www.github.com/mohnjatthews/friendsum">code on GitHub here</a></p>
