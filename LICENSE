THE FUCK-OFF-BIG-COMPANIES LICENSE
----------------------------------

Individuals are free to use this project as long as:

- They don't sell it.
- They aren't using it for a company with a revenue of USD 100,000,000 or more (hereby called BIG-ASS-COMPANIES)
- They add this license to their project.

BIG-ASS-COMPANIES who wish to use this project must double the salary of their lowest 10,000 employees in order to use this project. If the company has less than 10,000 employees, said company must employ enough random people off the street to fulfill the 10,000 employees requirement for at least one year and then pay them double the national minimum wage in their country.

I reserve the right to say certain companies cannot use this project, regardless of whether they fit the BIG-ASS-COMPANIES criteria or not.

If this project breaks your shit, it's not my fault.
