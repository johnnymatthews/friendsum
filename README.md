# friendsum
So this started out as a lorem-ipsum generator just for Friends, but now it's evolved into a lorem-ipsum generator for just about every TV on the ruddy planet. I think I have a problem.


Everything is Vanilla. No frameworks or JS libraries or CDNs or fonts to download. Just one file. This way you don't need to throw it into an electron wrapper just to run it locally when you're flying from London to New York or whatever. And as an added extra I'm not using any classes at all, mainly because I don't like them.
